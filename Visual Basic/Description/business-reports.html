    opportunity and its potential impact within your industry. This template is structured

    <font face="Arial" size="2">The Five Year Plan (Service Industry) template has been designed to help a financial
    services company --- such as a small bank, mortgage broker, or savings-and-loan
    company. The high-level financial plan defines your financial model and pricing
    assumptions with all other important aspects. This plan also includes expected annual
    sales and profits for the next five years. </font>
</p>
<p class="componentDescriptionTxt">
    <font face="Arial" size="2">When you click the Financial Plan hyperlink, a template file is used which
    has five worksheets named Model Inputs, Profit and Loss, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow and Loan Payment Calculator. All the sheets are filled with
    data with all its formatting using APIs of Aspose.Cells component to produce
    a complete 5 years Financial Plan for any Corporate. When you click the Cost Pareto
    hyperlink, here the demo utilizes an xml file, reads the xml data from the file
    to generate two reports named Cost Data and Pareto Chart each representing
    a worksheet in the workbook. The first report calculates the annual cost of different
    cost centers while the second worksheet presents a column chart based on the first
    worksheet data. You are allowed to either open the resultant excel file into
    your browser or save directly to your disk.</font></p>
