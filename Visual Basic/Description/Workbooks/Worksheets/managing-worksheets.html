<font face="Arial" size="2">This online demo describes how to manipulate (Add, Remove) worksheets in a 
workbook using
<a href="http://www.aspose.com/categories/file-format-components/aspose.cells-for-.net-and-java/default.aspx">
Aspose.Cells</a> for .NET.</font></p>
<p class="componentDescriptionTxt">
<font face="Arial" size="2">A workbook is a multi-page excel document. Each page in it is called
a worksheet. Aspose.Cells component is capable of manipulating worksheets.
For example, you can insert, remove and rename a sheet in a workbook. The demo
offers you two command buttons Add and Remove to exercise the manipulation
tasks. When you click on Add button, a workbook is created with a default
worksheet. It changes the name of the worksheet to My Worksheet1. It then,
adds two more worksheets to it named My Worksheet2 and My Worksheet3
respectively. When you click on Remove button, the demo makes use of an existing
excel file which has three worksheets in it. It then, removes the second worksheet
from the worksheets collection in the workbook. You can either open the resultant
excel files into MS Excel or save directly to your disk. </font>
