<font face="Arial" size="2">This online demo exhibits how to set page breaks (horizontal and vertical) in the worksheets 
using <a
href="http://www.aspose.com/categories/file-format-components/aspose.cells-for-.net-and-java/default.aspx">Aspose.Cells</a> 
for .NET.</font></p>
<p class="componentDescriptionTxt">
<font face="Arial" size="2">A <strong style="font-weight: 400">Page
    Break</strong> is the place in your data file where one page ends and the next
one begins. Aspose.Cells component allows you to add page breaks at any selected
cell of the worksheet. The location of the cell where the page break is added, page
is ended and the rest of the data after the page break will be printed on the next
page while printing. Moreover you may remove any existing page break too. The 
demo
creates an excel file and inputs some data into different cells of the first and
second column in the first worksheet of the workbook. i.e., A1, A2, A3, B1, B2, B3.
You are provided three command buttons for exercise. When you click Add button,
a page break is added at B2 cell. When you click Remove button, some
page breaks are added first and then removed using their index number in the collection.
When you click Clear button, all the page breaks (horizontal and vertical)
are deleted in the worksheet. You can either open the resultant excel files into
MS Excel or save directly to your disk to check the results. </font>
