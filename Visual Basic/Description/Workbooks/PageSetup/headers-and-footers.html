<font face="Arial" size="2">Sometimes, you would like to configure page setup
settings for your worksheets to control the printing process. For example, you may
need to set Page Headers and Footers in your worksheet. These page setup settings
are supported by Aspose.Cells component. The component allows you to add
headers and footers to the worksheets at runtime. To add headers and footers at
runtime, the component provides special <strong style="font-weight: 400">APIs</strong> and some 
<strong style="font-weight: 400">Script
    Commands</strong> to control the formatting of headers and footers. And you
need to understand the vocabulary of the script commands. For reference, Please
see <a href="http://www.aspose.com/documentation/file-format-components/aspose.cells-for-.net-and-java/setting-headers-and-footers.html">
    Headers &amp; Footers</a>. The demo makes use of an existing excel file,
opens it and implements date as a header and time as a footer in the first worksheet
of the workbook. You can either open the output excel file into MS Excel or save
directly to your disk and use Print Preview option to check the results in
MS Excel.</font>
