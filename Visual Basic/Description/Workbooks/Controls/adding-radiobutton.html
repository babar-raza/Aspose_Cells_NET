<font face="Arial" size="2">This demo shows how to add radio button control in your worksheet using <a

for .NET.</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN: 5pt 0pt"><span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">A 
Radio Button or an option button is a control made of a round box O. The user 
makes his or her decision by selecting or clicking the round box. Actually, a 
radio button is usually, if not always accompanied by other radio buttons. Such 
radio buttons appear and behave as a group. The user decides which button is 
valid by selecting only one of them. When the user clicks one button, its round 
box fills with a (big) dot. When one button in the group is selected, the other 
round buttons of the (same) group are empty.</font></span><font face="Arial" size="2"> 
The demo creates an excel file. Then by using simple Aspose.Cells APIs it adds 
three radio buttons as a group and apply different format setting to them. You may either open 
your resultant excel file into MS Excel or save directly to your disk. </font>
