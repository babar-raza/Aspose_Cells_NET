                        perform this operation and fill a <b>DataTable</b>'s rows and columns with data
                        from a worksheet's cells of the excel file. The demo gets data from a worksheet
                        of an excel file and exports it to fill a <b>DataTable</b>. The example also binds
                        the data table object to a <b>DataGrid</b> control.</p>

                        Shows how to perform data autofilter using Aspose.Cells. This demo exhibits how
                        to auto-filter data into the different cells of a worksheet. Many a times, you want
                        to work with subset data or a group of specific records. For example you might want
                        to print all the sales records for one salesperson or you might want to track all
                        the orders of one client. A filter is used to select records that meet a specific
                        criterion and temporarily hides all other records. <b>Aspose.Cells</b> is equipped
                        with auto-filter feature which you can use based on your requirements. The example
                        creates an excel file, fills the cells of the worksheet (two columns) with some
                        data and then applies auto-filter to filter data. You may either open your resultant
                        file into MS Excel or save directly to your disk.</p>

                        are the policies and procedures that governs how business operates. <b>Aspose.Cells</b>

                        creates an excel spreadsheet file and applies <b>Data Validation</b> on <b>B1</b>
                        cell in the first worksheet which forces only number b/w 0 and 10 can be entered
                        into the cell. An error message is shown in case of wrong entry. An input message
                        is always displayed on the cell too. You may either open your resultant excel file

                        SUM etc. String Functions are very useful to format displayed data in a sheet. <b>Aspose.Cells</b>
                        component supports some useful String Functions to manipulate textual data. For
                        example, you can concatenate, compare, find and replace text in the sheet. You can
                        get numeric code for a specified character in a text string. Similarly you can return
                        character specified by the code number. <b>Aspose.Cells</b> component can also perform

                        . You can use the labels of columns and rows on a worksheet to refer to the cells
                        within those columns and rows. You can create descriptive names to represent cells,
                        ranges of cells, formulas, or constant values. <b>Labels </b>can be used in formulas
                        that refer to data on the same worksheet; if you want to represent a range on another
                        worksheet, use a name. The demo creates a named range (<b>B1:E5</b>) of cells first.
                        It then, names the range. It then, accesses it by its name and puts some value into

                        The Demo explains how to set <b>Borders </b>to the cells<b> </b>in a worksheet.
                        <b>Borders </b>and<b> Color</b> provides you further ways to highlight information
                        in the cells in a worksheet. A <b>Border</b> is a line drawn around a cell or a

                        to draw <b>Borders</b> around the cells of your worksheet. The example creates an
                        excel file. It sets different Borders (Top, Bottom, Left, Right, DiagonalDown, DiagonalUp)
                        to <b>B2</b> cell of the first worksheet with a DashDot line style. It applies blue

                        Using <b>Aspose.Cells</b> component, you can format a complete row or column and
                        a range of cells too with a few lines of code using <b>Aspose.Cells</b> APIs. Consequently,

                        </b>and then apply this style to your desired row / column or range of cells. This
                        example creates an excel file, puts some string data into <b>A1</b> and <b>A2</b>,
                        puts a numeric value into <b>B1</b> cell. It also applies some <b>Font Attributes</b>
