<font face="Arial" size="2">This online demo demonstrates some alignment tasks related to text: e.g., text alignment,
orientation, text control and indentation. </font>
</p>
<p class="componentDescriptionTxt">
<font face="Arial" size="2">Aspose.Cells gives you the flexibility
to perform all the alignment tasks. You can align the text horizontally and
vertically, you may rotate the text to a certain degree, you are allowed to shrink
the text to fit in a cell, you can set the indentation level of the text in a cell,
you may wrap the text and set the text direction etc. The demo makes use of an
excel file and performs all the important alignment tasks mentioned above. You 
can either open the resultant excel files into MS Excel or save directly to your 
disk.</font></p>
