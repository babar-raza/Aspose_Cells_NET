<font face="Arial" size="2">This online demo describes how
to implement Page Setup Settings using <a

<font face="Arial" size="2">Many a times, you would like to configure
page setup settings for your worksheets to control the printing process. For example,
you may need to set <strong style="font-weight: 400">Print Area of the worksheet, Print Titles, Print Gridlines,
    Print Row/Column Headings, Print Black and Draft Quality, Print Comments, Print
    Cell Errors and Page Ordering, etc.</strong> All these page setup options are
available and supported in Aspose.Cells. The demo makes use of an existing
excel file, opens it and implements some page setup settings related to printing
for the first worksheet of the workbook. It sets a specific print area, print specific
title rows and columns, print grid lines, row / column headings, black and white
printing with comments on the worksheet. It also sets the printing with draft quality,
specifies the order and print cell errors. You can either open the resultant excel
file into MS Excel or save directly to your disk</font>.
