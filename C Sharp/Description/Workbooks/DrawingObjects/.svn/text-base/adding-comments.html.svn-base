<font face="Arial" size="2">This online demo exhibits how to add comments to the cells in a worksheet using
<a href="http://www.aspose.com/categories/file-format-components/aspose.cells-for-.net-and-java/default.aspx">
Aspose.Cells</a> for .NET. </font>

<font face="Arial" size="2">When
you are creating or editing a worksheet especially with others, It's often valuable
to be able to make comments that are not printed on the sheet but can be viewed on the
screen. Aspose.Cells 's Comments feature fits the bill. You can insert
comments, view comments and even edit the existing comments in the worksheet. You
may also remove comments of the cells. The demo creates an excel file. It adds
a comment to B1 cell of the first worksheet, accesses the comment and gives
it a string note. It also sets font, height and width of the comment. You can
either open the resultant excel file into MS Excel or save directly to your disk
to check the comments. </font>
