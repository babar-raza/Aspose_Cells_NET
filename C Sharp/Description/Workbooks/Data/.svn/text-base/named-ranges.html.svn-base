<font face="Arial" size="2">This demo explains how to create and access Named Ranges of cells in your 
worksheet using <a
href="http://www.aspose.com/categories/file-format-components/aspose.cells-for-.net-and-java/default.aspx">Aspose.Cells</a> 
for .NET. </font>
</p>
<p class="componentDescriptionTxt">
<font face="Arial" size="2">Aspose.Cells allows you to manipulate Named Ranges
. You can use the labels of columns and rows on a worksheet to refer to the cells
within those columns and rows. You can create descriptive names to represent cells,
ranges of cells, formulas, or constant values. Labels can be used in formulas
that refer to data on the same worksheet; if you want to represent a range on another
worksheet, use a name. The demo creates a named range (B1:E5) of cells first. It 
then, names the range. It then, accesses it by its name and puts some value into 
its left and bottom most cells with some formatting. You can either open the 
resultant excel files into MS Excel or save directly to your disk.</font></p>
